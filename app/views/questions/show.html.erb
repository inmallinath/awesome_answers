<h2>Answers</h2>
<h3>Create an Answer</h3>
<%# We can use the form after overriding the `url` parameter. The downside to it
is that it won't work for `edit` situation. This will only work in `create` situation.
So we can't reuse it if we decide to implement editing answers. %>
<%#= form_for @answer, url: question_answers_path(@question) do |f| %>
<%#end%>
<%# THE PREFERRED APPROACH %>
<%# Passing an array to the `form_for` is a better approach for creating nested
resources. This approach will work for both new/edit situations. So if @answer is not persisted
it will send a POST request to question_answers_path(@question). And if @answer is persisted it
will send a PATCH request to question_answer_path(@question, @answer) %>

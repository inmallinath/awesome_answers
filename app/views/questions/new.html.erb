<h1>New Question</h1>

<%# This will look for a partial named "_form" within the same folder as
    this template (new.html.erb). The partial will have access to the instance variables
    that this template has access to. You can pass local variables by passing a Hash
    to the partial as in:
    = render "form", my_var: my_variable
    son inside the form_partial you will have a local variable called my_var
    %>
<%= render "form"%>

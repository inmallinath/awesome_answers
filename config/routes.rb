# The main job of the routes:
# You map a request to a A controller with an action
get "/hello" => "welcome#index"


get "/about" => "welcome#about"

#providing the :as option will give us a route helper method. It will override the default one if any.
#Please note that route helpers only loop at the `path` portion of the route and not the HTTP verb.
#Helper methods must be unique.

get "/hello/:name" => "welcome#greet", as: :greet

# get "/questions/:id/edit" => "questions#edit", as: :edit_question
# patch "/questions/:id" => "questions#update"
# delete "/questions/:id" => "questions#destroy"
# the path for this URL (index action) is the same as the PATH for the
# create action (WITH POST) so we can just use the one we defined for the
# create which is `questions_path`
# get "/questions" => "questions#index" #, as: :questions

resources :questions do
  get :search, on: :collection

  # By defining `resources :answers` nested outside `resources :questions`
  # Rails will define all the answers routes prepended with
  # '/questions/:question_id'. This enables us to have the question_id handy
  # so we can create the answer associated with `question_id`
  resources :answers, only: [:create, :destroy]

  resources :likes, only: [:create, :destroy]
end

# We do this to avoid triple nesting comments under `resources :answers` within
  # the `resources :questions` as it will be very cumbersome to generate routes
  # and use forms. We don't need another set of `answers` routes in here so
  # pass the `only: []` option to it.
resources :answers, only: [] do
  resources :comments, only: [:create, :destroy]
end

# Setting the home page of our application to be the question listings page
root "questions#index"
# This will map any GET request with path "/hello" to WelcomeController and index action within that controller.

# Every user request in Rails must be handled by a controller and an action

# get is a method from rails routes to help us respond to a GET request. It takes a Hash as a paramenter
#get({"/hello" => "welcome#index"})


  # The priority is based upon order of creation: first created -> highest priority.
  # See how all your routes lay out with "rake routes".

  # You can have the root of your site routed with "root"
  # root 'welcome#index'

  # Example of regular route:
  #   get 'products/:id' => 'catalog#view'

  # Example of named route that can be invoked with purchase_url(id: product.id)
  #   get 'products/:id/purchase' => 'catalog#purchase', as: :purchase

  # Example resource route (maps HTTP verbs to controller actions automatically):
  #   resources :products

  # Example resource route with options:
  #   resources :products do
  #     member do
  #       get 'short'
  #       post 'toggle'
  #     end
  #
  #     collection do
  #       get 'sold'
  #     end
  #   end

  # Example resource route with sub-resources:
  #   resources :products do
  #     resources :comments, :sales
  #     resource :seller
  #   end

  # Example resource route with more complex sub-resources:
  #   resources :products do
  #     resources :comments
  #     resources :sales do
  #       get 'recent', on: :collection
  #     end
  #   end

  # Example resource route with concerns:
  #   concern :toggleable do
  #     post 'toggle'
  #   end
  #   resources :posts, concerns: :toggleable
  #   resources :photos, concerns: :toggleable

  # Example resource route within a namespace:
  #   namespace :admin do
  #     # Directs /admin/products/* to Admin::ProductsController
  #     # (app/controllers/admin/products_controller.rb)
  #     resources :products
  #   end
end
